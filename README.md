    `./snake_game --level hard` 
    

#### Java

1.  Make sure you have the Java runtime environment (JRE) installed on your system.
2.  Navigate to the directory where the Snake game code is located using the `cd` command.
3.  Use the `javac` command to compile the code:
    
    
    `javac SnakeGame.java` 
    
4.  Use the `java` command to run the class file:
    
    
    `java SnakeGame`
